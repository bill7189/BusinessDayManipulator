# Manipulate easily working days

* Find number of working days for a period.
* Find the ending date by adding the man day quantity to the starting date

## Install

* If you're using Composer to manage dependencies, you can use

```sh
composer require nuxia/business-day-manipulator
```

## Simple Manipulator
```php
use Nuxia\BusinessDayManipulator\Manipulator;

$holidays = [
    new DatePeriod(new \DateTime('2015-02-02'), new \DateTime('2015-02-06')),
    new \DateTime('2015-02-20')
];

$freeDays = [
    new DatePeriod(new \DateTime('2015-02-24'), new \DateTime('2015-02-27'))
];

$freeWeekDays = [
    Manipulator::SATURDAY,
    Manipulator::SUNDAY
];

$manipulator = new Manipulator($freeDays, $freeWeekDays, $holidays);
```

- **Free week days are repeated every week**
- **Holidays are repeated every year**
- **Free days are not repeated**

## Localized Manipulator

```php
use Nuxia\BusinessDayManipulator\LocalizedManipulator;

$holidays = [
    new DatePeriod(new \DateTime('2015-02-02'), new \DateTime('2015-02-06')),
    new \DateTime('2015-02-20')
];

$freeDays = [
    new DatePeriod(new \DateTime('2015-02-24'), new \DateTime('2015-02-27'))
];

$freeWeekDays = null; //If null, we will automatically set free week days from the locale.

//Guess automatically free week days.
$localizedManipulator = new LocalizedManipulator('Europe/Paris', 'fr', $freeDays, $freeWeekDay, $holidays);
```

## Working Day Date Predicator

```php
$manipulator->setStartDate(new \DateTime('2015-02-01'));
$manipulator->addBusinessDays(15);
$manipulator->getDate()->format('Y-m-d'); //2015-03-06
```

```php
$manipulator->setStartDate(new \DateTime('2015-03-06'));
$manipulator->subBusinessDays(15);
$manipulator->getDate()->format('Y-m-d'); //2015-02-01
```

## Working Day Quantity Predicator
```php
$manipulator->setStartDate(new \DateTime('2015-02-01'));
$manipulator->setEndDate(new \DateTime('2015-03-02'));

$manipulator->getBusinessDays(); //12
$manipulator->getBusinessDaysDate()); //Array of DateTime instance
```

## Manipulator::isBusinessDay()
```php
$manipulator->isBusinessDay(new \DateTime('2015-02-08')); //false
```

## Manipualtor::getTypeOfDay()
```php
$manipulator->getTypeOfDay(new \DateTime('2015-02-08')); // free_week_day
```
